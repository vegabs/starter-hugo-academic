Hello! 👋🏻 My name is Gabriela Vega, I’m an Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Student at [Peruvian University of Applied Sciences — UPC](http://upc.edu.pe/), Peru.

I’m interested in the interseccion of **technology + design** in the research areas of Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, AR/VR and Internet of Things.\
\
Currently, I’m a Visiting Undergraduate Researcher at the [Interactive Organisms Lab — UC Davis](http://iolab.ucdavis.edu/people.html), advised by Professor [Katia Vega](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=No4mGbsAAAAJ&hl=es) working on wearables for dogs using IMU sensors.\
\
I love to watch sci-fi movies and photography 📷. In my free time I like to learn new technologies, I consider myself a curious person and fast learner.\
\
Feel free to reach me out!
