Hello! 👋🏻 My name is Gabriela Vega, I’m an Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Student at [Peruvian University of Applied Sciences (UPC)](http://upc.edu.pe/), Lima, Peru. I’m interested in the interseccion of **technology + design** in the research areas of Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, AR/VR and Internet of Things.\
\
Currently, I’m doing a research internship at the [Interactive Organisms Lab (UC Davis)](http://iolab.ucdavis.edu/people.html), advised by Professor [Katia Vega](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=No4mGbsAAAAJ&hl=es) where I’m working on wearable for animals using IMU sensors.\
\
I love to watch sci-fi movies, code and photography 📷. In my free time I like to learn new technologies, I consider myself a curious person and fast learner.\
\
Feel free to reach me out!
