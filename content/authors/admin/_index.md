Hello ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m Gabriela Vega, a Masterâ€™s student in Media Informatics at Saarland University in Germany and a research assistant in the [Sensorimotor Interaction Group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://sensint.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), where I work on haptics and agency. Previously, I collaborated with Audrey Girouard and Karen Cochrane at [Carleton University](https://cil.csit.carleton.ca/), and with Katia Vega at [UC Davis](https://iolab.ucdavis.edu/).

I love watching sci-fi movies, traveling (Iâ€™ve visited over 20 countries!), crocheting, and swimming. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in projects or collaborations!
