Hello ðŸ˜Š It's Gabriela Vega, an Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Student. Iâ€™m interested in the interseccion ofÂ **technology + design**Â in the research areas of Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, AR/VR, Internet of Things and Computer Vision.\
\
Currently, Iâ€™m a Visiting Undergraduate Researcher at theÂ [Interactive Organisms Lab â€” UC Davis](http://iolab.ucdavis.edu/people.html), advised by ProfessorÂ [Katia Vega](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=No4mGbsAAAAJ&hl=es) working on wearable computing and HCI.\
\
I love to watch sci-fi movies and photography ðŸ“·. In my free time I like to learn new technologies, I'm curious and fast learner. Feel free to reach me out for projects and collaborations.
