Hello ðŸ˜Š It's Gabriela Vega, an Electrical Engineering undergrad. Iâ€™m interested in the interseccion ofÂ **technology + design**Â in the research areas of Human-Computer Interaction, wearables, AR/VR, IoT and Computer Vision for human augmentation and well-being.\
\
Currently, Iâ€™m an Intern at [Emphatic Computing Lab â€” University of Auckland](http://empathiccomputing.org/team/gabriela-vega/) and I'm a former Visiting Undergrad Researcher at theÂ [Interactive Organisms Lab â€” UC Davis](http://iolab.ucdavis.edu/people.html), advised byÂ [Katia Vega](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=No4mGbsAAAAJ&hl=es) working on wearable computing and HCI.

I love to watch sci-fi movies and photography ðŸ“·. In my free time I like to learn new technologies. Feel free to reach me out for projects and collaborations.
