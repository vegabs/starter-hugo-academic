abstract: "Flexibility and stretching exercises for dogs are used to improve
  joint motion and alleviate limb pain. However, there is a lack of information
  in the effectiveness of these canine exercises when performed by dog owners
  and caregivers. Current solutions for measuring range of motion are not
  designed to be worn by dogs. In order to evaluate the position of a joint at
  any given time, the user, the human assisting the dog in the exercises, must
  hold a digital or analog device while performing the exercise without
  real-time feedback associated with the dog's breed or joint exercised. We
  propose WOOFlex: a wearable that assists in canine flexibility exercises that
  (1) is attached to the dog's limbs so as to not interfere with the exercise,
  (2) includes IMU sensors to measure the joint angle, and a web application to
  (1) provide real-time visual and audio feedback for assisting the user in not
  exceeding safe joint angle ranges, and (2) to store exercise session data to
  monitor the flexibility progress."

summary: A wearable + web application to aid in canine flexibility activities.
  The system uses different feedback modalities to help the human user to
  perform the exercise correctly to aid the dog.
